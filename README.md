# clickreCaptcha
A cool Python script I made to send virtual clicks to reCaptcha buttons.

Usage:
 - Provide the bot with specific mouse coordinates of the reCaptcha button and watch it succesfully send a click there.  

Note: This does not solve reCaptcha it only sends unnoticed virtual clicks to an already solved instance of reCaptcha per user session.
